# NGC 2237 / Rose Nebula
NGC 2237 or the <strong>Rosette Nebula</strong> is a vast cloud of gas and dust stretching about 100 light years, it is also known to be a giant stellar nursery. 

It is in the direction of the constellation of the Unicorn in 4500 light years from our solar system.

The image shows a part of the Rosette Nebula, the center is on the lower left.

What characterizes this image is a sculpture designed by the dark dust globules that range from low in the upper left of the image. We found this tape on the left image. 

The thin band of dust and gas in the center, are eroded by the energetic radiation and winds of massive central stars on the left, which were formed there are 4 million years. 

These stars emit ultraviolet radiation that ionize surrounding clouds of hydrogen, which gives the red color on the picture cons, taken by the telescope of 0.9 m from the National Science Foundation of Kitt Peak. 

On the image, the colors are unique, sulfur appears in red, green hydrogen and oxygen in blue. The Rosette Nebula is expressed as "broadcast ".

The brightest parts of the Rosette are variously called NGC2237, NGC2238, NGC2239 and NGC2246. 

The star cluster NGC2244 center is named, and houses of very hot stars of type O to the origin of ultraviolet radiation that shines gas from the Rosetta. 

The 6 bright stars of the open cluster NGC 2244, the center of the nebula can locate it under a very dark sky.
